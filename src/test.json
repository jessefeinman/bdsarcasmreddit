You have just shown that we can do the same for brainfuck + a reasonable preprocessor. Thus my point stands, the discussion is moot as stated.\r\n\r\nHowever. Less is more; to my limited experience, closures compose in substantially more generic and interesting ways than multi-slotted objects. Less is more; closures (if used right) have also the nice property of being immutable, thus one can actually reason about them. Not to mention that the only interesting thing about object theory is subtyping polymorphism, which is a mere crutch. The content of the methods is never proved covariant, not even in theory.

But I have a happy day job using Java/.NET technologies.  I don't tell my co-workers, because they would think I was as crazy as this post says I am.  Why am I learning C?  Why would anyone use C?\n\n1. To better understand how memory is used.  If you saw some of the code I see daily, it's clear that your average coder has no idea, for example, why in Java to use a StringBuffer instead of + for joining strings.\n\n2. Like it or not, it will be around forever.    A friend of mine writes video codecs, entirely in C, then optimizes in assembler.  For this task there's no better tool.  Also, the Linux kernel, and in fact a good part of all Linux programs are written in C.  And, as the poster points out, all language runtimes and OS'es are written in C or C++.\n\n3. Does memory footprint matter?  If virtualization is the future, then memory footprint matters more than ever.  A virtualized server won't have 2G of RAM (no Vista here!), but closer to 128/256M.\n\n4. OOP is not so special that it renders all other technologies obsolete (and this from a Java/.NET programmer!)  Good use of design patterns (Strategy, etc.) often involves replacing inheritance with composition.  In real-life OOP, it's rare to see useful inheritance more than two levels away from Object (outside of maybe UI toolkit code).  Anyway, inheritance can be simulated easily enough in C, for those moments when inheritance would be really helpful.\n\nThat's why I'm learning C.","author":"erikmack","link_id":"t3_5ybcs","score":82}

By raising a kid you implicitly take a hand in determining the direction of the entire human race.\n\nAs I said, bikes and cars only put a very few people at risk at any one time, but raising another Pol Pot, or Cheney, or Kim-Jong Il has exactly the same effect, and more, to thousands or millions of people.\n\nI understand that killing people who are already alive is bad (obviously), and that pretty much everyone (present US administration aside) subscribes to the idea of inalienable human rights - I also do.\n\nWhat I'm not so clear on is why having children is one of these inalienable human rights - you can live a perfectly fulfilled life without siring offspring (no-one's saying don't have sex, or offer to help with other people's kids).\n\nWe already routinely screen child-care workers, teachers, babysitters and the like to determine if they're \"suitable\" to work with kids... but we don't screen the one or two people who spend the vast majority of their time with the child, and from whom the child derives the majority of their young experience and opinions - whether educational or traumatising.\n\nWe also ban paedophiles (for example) from any contact with children... and yet someone who picks up their baby in a fit of pique and uses it to club their partner in the head, fracturing the kids skull and putting its very *life* at risk... is free to go on banging out sprogs as long as she wants.\n\nYou've probably guessed by now that I'm playing devil's advocate, but I'm still curious to see if anyone can give me a good answer.\n\nI take your point about the risk of letting in eugenics by the back-door... but why does the determining factor have to be anything controversial?\n\nBefore you're allowed to have a kid you have to take a few parenting classes, you have to demonstrate you have the material resources to care for this kid *in addition to* any you already have, and you perhaps have to undergo a short counselling course to make sure you want to have a kid for the right reasons (ie, because you want to raise one, not because you're trying to save a marriage, or need someone to bully, or want a bigger welfare cheque).\n\nFail the tests (or pass them and then mistreat your kid) and you lose the right to any more, either for a defined period and/or until you reapply and pass the test again.\n\nNone of these things should reasonably prevent someone from having at least one or two kids - even families on welfare can afford to raise a couple of kids.\n\nWhat it will do is stop people having kids for the wrong reasons, having more kids than they can reasonably support, and it'll emphasize that having kids should be an honour and an obligation to treat the kid right, not a god-given right you can abuse at will, or a route to a larger state handout.\n\nAs I said, I don't fully believe this - it's a hypothetical thought experiment... but what's wrong with it?","score_hidden":false,"author_flair_text":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"retrieved_on":1427426398,"name":"t1_c029a5o","parent_id":"t1_c0299tc","created_utc":"1192459599","controversiality":0,"ups":3,"distinguished":null,"id":"c029a5o","subreddit_id":"t5_6","downs":0,"archived":true}

There are thousands of people working day and night trying to come up with real solutions to global warming from alternate fuels and cattle feeds to the project to build a fusion reactor which theoretically could produce unlimited, clean, safe energy (or at least more than we could ever use up).\r\n\r\nEven as a documentry it's not scientifically good, it's full of questionable assumptions, cherry picked stats and scare tactics. Nothing annoys me more than having every piece of weather we don't like blamed on global warming as it's a flawed assumption of an extremely complex weather system. Katrina was enivitable, we had hurricanes when the earth was cool, at some point the weather was going to destroy those levees.\r\n\r\nA Judge in the UK listed 14 major faults with the documentry that meant it couldn't be classed as an educational film.

Memory use should be only the size of the working set unless the programmer chooses to trade memory resizing for performance.\n\nAlas, all languages i know of are sorely lacking in one (or more) of these departments, so you'll still have to use the right tool for the job -- there's no silver programming language bullet, yet.\n\n\"When C is better\n\nIt isn't all roses, of course.

As a result, it runs quickly, and in a small amount of memory. In contrast, the Haskell program allocates quite a lot of extra memory behind the scenes, and runs rather slower than the C program.\n\nIn effect, the C quicksort does some very ingenious storage management, trading this algorithmic complexity for a reduction in run-time storage management costs.\n\nIn applications where performance is required at any cost, or when the goal is detailed tuning of a low-level algorithm, an imperative language like C would probably be a better choice than Haskell, exactly because it provides more intimate control over the exact way in which the computation is carried out.\""}

But you should hear the way Al Gore  and both of the Clintons are constantly put down on shows like Shawn Hannity.  They can do no good thing in Mr. Hannity's eyes.  \"Hannity's America\" indeed and every time I hear someone say \"YER A GRATE AMERICAN SHAWN\" I just want to scream.  Some people just buy what Fox News is selling outright without checking the facts. That started to really change for me when I saw how unfairly they were treating Bill Clinton who even if he was doing bad stuff once before, is now at least trying to redeem himself and I am not sure he ever was a bad person in the first place and not just framed and shot down by the corporate media.  This documentary is pretty enlightening.\n\nhttp://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=411888315354425208\n\n   Personally, I wish Bill Clinton was back in office right now and we had the sort of problems we had then.  He at least tried to get Osama Bin Laden. It is funny too because as far as I can see, Bill Clinton has started supporting some great humanitarian causes and is trying to do some good in the world and after what happened to that guy, it is a wonder that he doesn't hate everyone and just hide in the closet or something.  As far as it goes for me and what I believe about the environment, I believe what the Bible says and what it says in Genesis 8:21-22 and Genesis 9:9-9:16.

If the bit isn't flipped, then it will set the alarm off.\n\nThere would be no reason to use the same schema for designing a currency barcoding system.

I'm also not talking about rendering the offender sterile of anything permanent - simply ban them from having children, with immediate adoption of the child and *incredibly* harsh punishment for anyone who violates the ban.\n\nPeople can use birth control if they want, or they can simply refrain from penetrative sex.  Either way, they are no longer allowed to be the primary caregiver of a child, since they have proven themselves unworthy of the honour.\n\nWe ban people from driving who have abused the privilege, and that's not *really* all that dangerous.  Why not ban people from having another kid, if they've already proven themselves incapable of the job?\n\n&gt; The same thing happened with \"literacy tests\" that blacks had to take to vote. Imagine how a parent test could be distorted to reinforce social institutions and prevent people that society doesn't like from breeding!\n\nFair point.  But generally as a society we already have a system which assesses if someone's a \"bad parent\", and removes the kid if so.  What's so hard about removing a kid and then banning the offender from having any more?\n\n&gt; The only way I could see it working is if you had some sort of genetic criteria for reproducing, and, while it could work, I have a feeling that people couldn't get eugenics out of their minds for long enough to even consider it.\n\nWhy such basic and genetic conditions?  I'm talking about being financially able to support another kid (in addition to any they've already got), not having any prior convictions for child-abuse or domestic violence, maybe undergoing a short course of parenting and anger-management classes, and a short course of counseling to ensure they're having kids for the right reasons (\"because I want to raise a child well\", rather than \"this will save my marriage\" or \"this will get us a bigger welfare cheque\").\n\nAs i mentioned in the other post, I'm playing devil's advocate here - I don't honestly believe that this is necessarily the way forward, but I'm curious as to why everyone's *so* against they'll refuse to even contemplate the hypothetical scenario.\n\nIt appears we've hit upon another of society's irrational taboos, and people would rather downmod-and-forget than discuss it openly. &lt;:-)","author":"Shaper_pmp","link_id":"t3_5ybds","score":1,"name":"t1_c029aa5","retrieved_on":1427426397,"author_flair_css_class":null,"edited":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","controversiality":0,"ups":1,"created_utc":"1192460462","parent_id":"t1_c029a4s","archived":true,"downs":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","id":"c029aa5","distinguished":null}

Economic theory has contrived a species it calls Homo economicus\u2014a \u201crational maximiser\u201d who grabs what he can for himself.

If he rejects it, both players receive nothing.\n\nHomo economicus would accept any division in which his share was not zero. But that is not what happens. Scores of studies have run the ultimatum game across cultures and ages. Universally, people reject any share lower than 20%\u2014apparently to punish the greed of the proposer.

As you say, Reddit no longer has the option 'also submit to Reddit.com' when submitting to a subreddit. Effectively, for submissions, reddit.com has become another subreddit, a catch-all category. Also, as you point out, the page Reddit.com is the old my.reddit, i.e. it only shows stories from our selected subreddits. This has the potential to return our Reddit experience to something sane, by also implementing these steps:\n\n\nAdd an 'other' subreddit, for articles that don't fit any other category, to replace Reddit.com in the 'submit' dialog.\n\nNote in Rediquette that it is acceptable or encouraged to downvote for miscategorisation.\n\nWhat are the effects of this? If I have a story, say \"Bush administration does bad thing\", I will now have a strong incentive to post to politics subreddit. If I don't, it's just in the 'other' category and liable not to get too much notice. \n\nIf I am a non-politics-liking Redditor, I will no longer see that post. \n\nNote that this would work as is, without any further change, if we just start to think in this way and mod accordingly.\n\nWhile doing that, it would be good to reinstate features subreddit, for all discussion of Reddit itself.\n\nAnd as a discussion point, maybe a poll.reddit is called for too.

That said; England defended strongly enough that France didn't get the chance to break through, despite being given lots of possession.\n\nAs one of the commentators said during the game, semi-finals are just about winning.  There's no other consideration.\n\n**Note for readers unfamiliar with rugby:** it's a fast and constantly-moving game in which a player who is tackled is immediately stepped over by his team-mates ('rucking'), allowing the ball to be picked up and possession retained.  From what I remember of school rugby, playing in the forward line is an exhausting round of crashing into rucks, picking yourself up and getting into the next one.\n\nThere are also mauls, where the tackled player stays on his feet and a big pushing match occurs.  The thing is, these and the common stoppage plays (scrums and lineouts) are all *generally* won by the side who has possession, but not *exclusively* so.  So defence lies in being organised, getting into place so the opponents can't break through, and forcing turnovers where you can.\n\nEngland did this well enough that they avoided losing the game, despite giving up a lot of possession with bad kicking.  (Kicking up the field gains lots of territory, but for it to be a win, you need to kick the ball to a position where it's difficult for the opposing back line to quickly catch and return it).\n\nThe above explanation won't satisfy a rugby purist, but may help to describe the game to Americans.

Ok you don't have a closures, the memory business is still manual (even if with good libraries and valgrind it's much simpler than raw C), and so on, but using 'structures' and a good dose of functional approach and bottom-up design you can write good modular C programs that are simple to develop, read, fix.\n\nSo... if the difference gets smaller you start *seriously* to see the good points of C: it's fast, the interface with the operating system is not mediated, there are **static checks!** when you compile. If everything compiles well and you test the application there are very little chances that the user will see a runtime error because a name of a var was a typo.\n\nThere are even advantages that are about being low-level: programmers able good C programs care a lot about a data structure being O(1) or O(N^2) in certain kind of operations, it's like if every part of the program is written with more \"computer science\" in mind.\n\nI think this all the reasons why in pratice a lot of the best software available is written  in C.

Many airlines sell food, and that's okay, but they **sell** *peanuts* and *trail mix*.  They do give free non-alcoholic drinks, but only in tiny quantities, and only have, as an example, instant coffee.  This would be fine if they didn't load up their 737's with what feels like a 10\" seat pitch.  Add in that the crews are not particularly friendly, nor is anything about the airline convenient, and damn, I have a hard time recommending them.  To say the least.\n\nAirTran, nothing special in my book, is much better.  JetBlue is in a different universe.

Right-wingers tend to favour market based approaches, technological \"fixes\" (e.g. deflecting light from the sun to reduce the amount impacting upon Earth -- see editorial in today's WSJ), and in some sense wishful (although some would say relatively reasonable) thinking (e.g. Lomborg and the notion that increasing temperature means more arable land).\n\nGiven that the evaluation of policy proscriptions, whether right- or left-wing, can take many years to effect, and they are subject to considerable uncertainty, I would say that the issue is indeed debatable, and is far from \"down-in-the-mud, God-given, use-your-brain, fucking common sense\".

It is not a charity, so their test demonstrating people's reasoning with the \"save children\" donation is not an accurate representation of what we're seeing here.  Why are they different?  With a donation charity such as the one described, the benefit to cost ratio for an individual is so close to zero (the nigh imperceptible, though admittedly real, benefit to the whole of society), that there is no immediate benefit to the donator himself for giving the money.    \n\n\nRadiohead's \"tip\" system is something else entirely.  Yes, currency is something you exchange for goods and services.  That we know.  From that point of view, paying less is always better for the consumer.  But currency is also a vote, a statement of endorsement.  It's a Pavlovian instigator for service rendered.  \n\nI tip the hairstylist after a good cut.  She's rewarded for good action.  She's more likely to try harder with my hair in the future.  By association, that connection is also demonstrated in front of her compatriots.  So they too are likely to make the association between good cut (extra effort) and good money.\n\nIt's also a vote for non-tip payment events.  For example, there's now a chance of a Serenity 2 because the first run of Serenity dvd's sold out.  Company sees profitability, hence is more likely to follow up with similar content.  A very successful movie of type A is likely to generate additional movies of type A from other directors as well.\n\nWhen we pay for downloading Radiohead's music, it's a vote.

This article is extremely poorly written, *not* thought invoking, and entirely misrepresents the idea of stopping time.  Here is a little exert to show what i mean:\n\n&gt;What superpower would I have? Immediately the first thing that came to mind was the ability to pause time, similar to the Japanese guy in Heroes. Can you imagine how great it would be to have that superpower? I could potentially stay in bed for hours, press play when I wanted to go to work and pause time again for an extended three hours lunch break. More importantly, I could rob banks and make myself filthy rich and never have to work again. Nobody would see me. I could even be a good Samaritan and pause time as someone was about to get hit by a car, dive heroically pushing them out of the way and save them from certain death.\n\n&gt;However, being the nerd that I am I started to see the shortcomings in this superpower. It would mess up my body clock. The world would think its 8am and my body would think it is 11am. I would start to fall asleep at 7pm or 8pm. That wouldn\u2019t be much fun especially if I was planning a night out away from my computer screen. Perhaps a night in front of the TV instead.\n\n&gt;Secondly, if I pause time, will it just be people who pause or will machines pause as well? Will the CCTV keep running as I rob Chase Manhattan Bank for the second time? If machines pause as well, will that mean that the electrons that power my electricity will stop spinning?\n\n&gt;I would no longer be able to spend countless hours on Facebook, Reddit and You Tube. My BitTorrent downloads would cease! Oh the pain! It was time to find a new superpower as I twisted and turned in my bed.\n\nStopping time.  How would this mess with your biological clock?  stop time again and get a full nights rest, fuck around until your perceived time matches up with the actual time, and then start time again.  not a hard concept.  Also, of course machines would stop too.  Stopping time is not the same as stopping people; everything ceases to move (including those little electrons and shit that power this fag's computer, so i guess he can't fucking poke people on facebook).  When you would start time, it would be as if it was never stopped, so electronics wouldn't shut down.\n\nThe part of this superpower that gets me is vision.  Our eyes capture and interpret reflected light into images.  If light stops moving, how would we see?\n\nneedless to say, this article got a downmod from me.

The future of renewables should be about how to compartmentalize and localize energy creation. So each household is responsible for and the producer of its own electricity and, ideally, a significant percentage of its food. I love solar energy as a technology but these giant star-wars programs are pork barrel projects that are designed to cost at least ten times what they claim, take generations to see implemented in any meaningful way and even less time to see them fail miserably before ending up just another hunk of space debris for people to look for on Google sky.\n\nI'd also like to mention some pretty controversial research regarding the theory of Peak Oil that involves work done by the Russians who still hold the record for deepest hole ever drilled. Apparently there are some pariah's in the scientific community who suggest Oil is in fact \"abiotic\" and not the result of compressed \"dino bones\" but created somewhere below the Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity and carried to the surface by methane.\n\nDownmod me if you like for expressing the view that perhaps Peak Oil is completely wrong at best and a calculated fabrication at worst. But thats the beauty of science, is it not? \n\nAs much as I hate the pollution \"fossil fuels\" generate, I really hate the idea that OPEC and the worlds major Oil producers are manipulating us by creating artificial scarcity in order to raise profits. I hope I'm wrong, and that the exploration being done by the Russians and others is ultimately fruitless but the question: \"What is Oil and where does it come from?\" still seems up for debate even after over 150 years of exploitation.

It infuriates Republicans that Gore receives so much recognition (culminating in his shared Nobel prize) for what they perceive to be, well, doing nothing. Gore is a talker, a champion of causes, but the fact that he gets so much recognition for this, instead of the \"doers\" (scientists, researchers), clashes with conservative values. This is why he got jumped all over for the (incorrect) quote about inventing the internet, because it proves their point that he's just out to puff up his chest and steal the limelight from the people that matter.\n\n \n2. Global Warming awareness seeks to limit your (and businesses) freedom to do whatever the hell you want...and Al Gore is the face of this cause. \"How dare Al Gore tell me I have to stop driving my Tahoe!\" Repubs think responsibility for climate change should be up to the individual, not government regulation.\n\n3. Al Gore is perceived as a hypocrite. Right around the time when An Inconvenient Truth was up for awards, the news came out that his mansion in Tennessee used double the power in a month as most American households use in a year...oops.  \n\n\nSo basically, while you may believe Repubs hate Al Gore because he's smart, they actually hate him because they believe he's an idiot. \n ","score_hidden":false,"link_id":"t3_5ybes","score":27,"author":"moriya","retrieved_on":1427426389,"name":"t1_c029aww","author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false}

I suspect that a reasonable number of other people are in the same position. On the other hand, I'm sure most commercial users have one f the more expensive packages, and wouldn't be bothered. This sort of thing wasn't important a few years ago, but these days people expect multi-platform applications, and Lispworks, with its platform-independent GUI stuff, could be a great way to produce them. \n\nTypically, with other languages, there exist free or very cheap tools which allow hobbyists to create their own distributable, easy-to-install, GUI applications.

Do you guys find odd that Democrats give support to poor and middle class people while Republicans rive support to the rich, and since there are a lot of poor and middle class than there is rich that Republicans can still compete in elections? \n\nOne reason for this problem is due to the fact that many poor people dont vote.  Even without counting that fact, there should still be an overwhelming amount of people in middle class and poor class that do vote.  \n\nIt is obvious that there are many poor and middle class people that does not support the government that supports them.  I call these people the 'stupid people.'\n\nMy theory is that republicans rely on these stupid people for office.  They want to protect the right for Americans to be stupid.  This will explain a couple of things.  Education is always on the bottom of the list of things to do for Republicans.  They want to constantly cut school fundings.  This will ensure that the most of the Americans that rely on public education to remain stupid and ignorant.  \n\nThis also explains why Republicans hate Gore.  Since Gore has the IQ to be a genius (if he was to be president he would have been the smartest President we've ever had), the republicans despise him.  For one, whether if he is a president or a Nobel Peace Prize winner, people may idolize him or may even aspire to be like him.  If the Americans actually started to value education, then what a scary world it may become for the republicans.","author_flair_text":null,"gilded":0}

There are a lot of other posts written on the subjectivity of what defines good parenting (or bad parenting).\n\nI suspect that the major knee jerk reaction most people have against regulating child bearing is the invasiveness of it, and the problems with implementation.

About 1 in 100 women on the pill will get pregnant in any given year, and 2 in 100 couples using condoms. (And this is assuming proper usage.) Also, there is rape. What do you do to these people?

And that rhetoric of name calling and \"you're stupid\" has been picked up by every AM radio host and right wing pundit since. Some of the most vile, disgusting, immature, insulting ad hominem ever spoking has come from the mouths of Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter and their contemporaries. Hell, just look at the *title* of Coulter's newest book: \"If Democrats Had Any Brains, They'd Be Republicans\" - or the titles of any of her previous ones. Or the titles of Sean Hannity's books: \"Deliver Us from Evil: Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism\" comes to mind. And that's just the titles, let alone the vitriol found inside these volumes, and let alone the stuff that spews from their mouths.\n\nFor years, the Democrats and left wing punditry *did* stay above it, and look what it got them. Finally we're starting to see some of the vitriol returned in kind (and then, mostly from the netroots rather than mainstream punditry).\n\n&gt; Since I don't think I'm an idiot, and they seem to be acting like childish idiots, I don't really see what the Democratic side has to offer me.\n\nSo what, I would ask you, does the Republican side offer you? Why do Democrats turn you off for calling others idiots, but not Republicans?\n\nGranted, I'd love if the political discourse in this country was civil, high minded, and rational - but it ain't. Let's face it - if there's one thing that Limbaugh proved in the last 20 years, it's that such childish name calling *works*. It's not the left to blame for that.

For the fans, however, there's an incentive to pay nothing and hope that everybody else ponies up. That way you get more Radiohead in the future without paying a red cent.\n\nI'm appalled that they quoted an economist saying \"we don't understand tipping.\" We do.

Economists tend to distinguish between demand and supply and the decline of production of minerals might be seen as the result of cheaper or safer substitutes entering the market, that is to a reduction of the demand. It would be tempting to attribute the decline in production of mercury to this factor. Mercury is a toxic metal which has been substituted with various other materials and devices and it is now slowly disappearing from the market. But most of the legislation forbidding the use of mercury came much later than the mercury peak (1962) and, as we saw, mercury peaked almost exactly at the \u201cmidpoint\u201d of the available reserves, as predicted by the standard Hubbert model. A similar case, reduction in the demand, can be made for the peaking of lead, another poisonous metal. But for many applications, for instance car batteries, no substitute has been found so far for lead.

So, they're respect from Wash only went for far. \n\nRemember, Washington tried to have what would be considered a modern Unity Government in the beginning.  He had both Hamilton and Jefferson in his original cabinet.   After a while it became apparent to Tom Jeff that Wash was listening more to Hamilton than to him though.  So, he resigned to go start forming the Democratic Republicans and hopped to become the next President.  \n\nHamilton pissed off too many people himself... even within the proto-Federalist party... So, they united behind an \"anybody but Hamilton\" standard... and nominated John Adams to lead them into the next Election.  Adams was distant enough from the public relations problems of Hamilton to get himself elected as Washington's successor instead of Jefferson.  "}
